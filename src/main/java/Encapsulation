Encapsulation is a process of wrapping or binding data members with its relates member functions in a single entity called as class

example: Java Bean Class

1. class should be public non abstract class
2. class should have public non parameterized constructor
3. Variable or data members should be declared as private
4. Those data members should have respective public getter and setter method
5. class should implement a marker interface called as serializable.

Advantages
Validation can be done.
Flexible ie. data can be made either write only or read only.
